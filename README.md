# To-Do-list_Java
This project is a desktop-based To-Do list application built using Swing that allows users to manage daily tasks through an interactive GUI.

## Basic Architecture
The basic console to-do needs a menu system and an array.
The array will be used to store the user input and we can also remove some of the tasks. As this is currently a console based application, we can add in that as a menu system option.
The menu system will look like this
1.Add Tasks
2.View Tasks
3.Remove Tasks
4.Exit

The menu system class will be run on loop and switch-case statement for now. The tasks will be added and removed using dynamic arrays. For user input we'll use Scanner input.
The above architecture is only for a console based application.
